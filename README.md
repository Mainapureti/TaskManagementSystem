# Task-Management-App
You are required to build a app using react.
first we have to take new teraminal and give the command is: npx create-react-app task manager
Navigate to the project directory: Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory by running:cd task-manager
Clean up default files: By default, Create React App generates some files and code that you may not need for your task manager project. You can delete the src/App.js and src/App.css files, as well as the contents of the src/index.css file.
Create components: In the src directory, create a new directory named components. Inside the components directory, create the necessary components for your task manager, such as TaskList.js, Task.js, AddTaskForm.js, etc. You can use functional components or class components based on your preference.
Implement functionality: In each component, implement the necessary functionality for your task manager. For example, TaskList.js can handle displaying a list of tasks, Task.js can represent an individual task, and AddTaskForm.js can handle adding new tasks to the list.
Run the project: Once you've implemented the necessary components and functionality, you can run your project locally. In the project directory, run the following command:
shell
*npm start
This starts the develop![Command](https://github.com/Mainapureti/Task-Management-App/assets/137265043/37b4893c-8d59-4c82-9e5f-8d76f71884d2)
ment server, and your task manager application should open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.
A task management app typically consists of a user interface that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete tasks. The UI can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and styled with CSS. Headers and tables are commonly used elements in task management apps to organize and display task information.

Here's an example of how you can structure a task management app using CSS, headers, and tables:![Screenshot (55)](https://github.com/Mainapureti/Task-Management-App/assets/137265043/1e907499-3d98-4c60-9b26-021a35e4ee4d)
